# Requirement Analysis Document: "Aegis" Platform

## 1. Business Objective & Current State Analysis

**Primary Business Objective:** To implement a secure, centralized, and auditable system to manage the complete lifecycle of critical internal documents (policies, procedures, memos). The goal is to enhance operational efficiency, ensure regulatory compliance (including GDPR), and mitigate security risks associated with uncontrolled document handling.

**Current State Analysis:** The current process relies on manual, email-based workflows for document drafting, approval, and distribution. This creates significant inefficiencies, lacks a formal audit trail, poses security risks from unauthorized data circulation, and offers no mechanism to confirm that employees have read and understood critical information.

**Problem Statement:** The organization lacks a formal system for document governance, leading to operational inefficiencies, increased compliance risk, and potential security vulnerabilities.

## 2. The Solution Concept: "Aegis"

"Aegis" is a web-based Document Governance Platform designed to replace manual processes with a secure, automated, and controlled environment. It will serve as the single source of truth for all official company documents, managing their journey from initial draft to final archival.

* **Approver Journey:** A manager receives an email notification of a pending approval. They log into Aegis, review the document and its change history, and provide their approval or rejection with comments.
* **Employee Journey:** A team member receives a notification that a new policy has been published. They log in, read the document, and click a button to confirm they have "Read and Understood" it.
