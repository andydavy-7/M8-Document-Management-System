- `userPreferences`: Theme, layout, shortcuts

## v0.app Prompt

```
Build a sophisticated mock-only Next.js 14 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui enterprise document management system called "ComplianceHub DMS". Create a fully interactive prototype that DEMONSTRATES the complete user experience without real backends. All data is mocked, all actions show realistic feedback through toasts/modals/animations.

Core Layout:
- Top header: Left (logo + "ComplianceHub DMS" brand), Center (global search with cmd+k), Right (notification bell with count, user avatar with role badge, settings gear)
- Left sidebar (collapsible on mobile): Navigation items with icons - Dashboard, Documents, Workflows, Approvals, Compliance, Analytics, Users, Settings
- "Demo Mode" and "Version 2.0" badges in header
- Dark mode toggle in user menu

Dashboard:
- 4 KPI cards in a row: Compliance Rate (with circular progress), Pending Approvals (with urgency indicator), Active Documents, Overdue Reviews (with warning styling)
- Quick Actions grid: 4 large buttons with icons (Upload, New Workflow, Audit Report, Send Reminders)
- Recent Activity timeline with user avatars and action descriptions
- Department compliance heatmap grid with color coding

Documents Library:
- Top toolbar: Search bar, filter chips (Type, Status, Department), view toggle (grid/list), "Upload Document" primary button
- Document cards in grid: File type icon, title, version badge, status badge, modified date, owner avatar, hover actions (preview, download, workflow)
- Click opens drawer with tabs: Preview (mock PDF viewer), Details (all metadata), Versions (comparison slider), Audit Trail (timeline), Acknowledgments (progress + user list)
- Upload shows multi-step wizard with drag-drop, metadata form, workflow selection

Workflow Designer:
- Visual canvas with drag-drop nodes (Start, Approval, Condition, End)
- Left panel: node palette, saved templates
- Right panel: node configuration when selected
- Connection lines with animation showing flow direction
- Test Run button shows simulated execution with step highlighting

Approval Queue:
- Filter pills: My Tasks, Delegated, Overdue
- Approval cards: Document info, submitter, time waiting, SLA indicator, quick approve/reject buttons
- Review opens side panel with document viewer, comments thread, approval form with digital signature component

Compliance Center:
- Compliance gauge (0-100% animated)
- Acknowledgment tracking table with status badges and reminder actions
- Audit package generator with framework selection (ISO, GDPR, HIPAA)
- Retention manager with documents approaching retention dates

Analytics:
- Interactive charts using mock data: Approval Time Trend, Compliance by Department, Document Growth
- Report builder with drag-drop metrics
- Saved reports gallery with thumbnails

Mock Behaviors:
- All buttons show appropriate toasts ("Document uploaded successfully", "Workflow saved", "Approval submitted")
- Forms validate with error states but don't persist
- Searches filter mock data in real-time
- Modals and drawers animate smoothly
- Loading states show skeletons
- Success actions show confetti or checkmark animations
- Add a "Reset Demo" button in settings to restore initial state

Sample Data:
- 20+ documents across various types (Policy, Procedure, Form, Guide)
- 5+ departments with different compliance levels
- 10+ users with different roles
- Multiple workflows in different states
- Recent activities and notifications

Make it feel production-ready with polished interactions, proper loading states, and thoughtful empty states. Focus on demonstrating the complete user journey from document upload through approval to compliance tracking.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- All 8 main views accessible and functional with mock data
- Document upload wizard completes with success feedback
- Workflow designer allows node creation and connection
- Approval actions show toast confirmations
- Compliance dashboard displays realistic metrics
- Analytics charts are interactive with hover states
- Mobile responsive with appropriate touch interactions
- Search and filters work across all data tables
- User can complete full journey: upload â†’ workflow â†’ approval â†’ compliance

## Out of Scope (Prototype)
- Real authentication or user sessions
- Actual file upload/storage
- Backend API calls
- Data persistence between sessions
- Real PDF rendering (use placeholder)
- Actual email sending
- Third-party integrations

## Implementation Notes
- Use `setTimeout` to simulate async operations
- Store mock data in context/state for session persistence
- Use Faker.js or similar for realistic mock data
- Implement optimistic updates with simulated rollback
- Add subtle animations for premium feel
- Include helpful empty states with CTAs
- Show progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Use toasts for success/error feedback
