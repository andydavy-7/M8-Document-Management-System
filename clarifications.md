# Clarification Questions (clarifications.md)

The following points require stakeholder confirmation to finalize the scope of the Document Management System (DMS):

## 1. Deployment Preferences
- What percentage of clients are expected to prefer **on-premise** vs. **cloud** deployment?
- For cloud deployment, should we prioritize **AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud**, or remain provider-agnostic?

## 2. Licensing & Pricing
- Should the solution be offered under a **subscription model** (SaaS), perpetual license, or both?
- Do clients expect a **pay-per-use model** (e.g., storage, OCR usage), or strictly tiered packages?

## 3. Integration Scope
- Beyond Adobe Sign, are integrations with **ERP/CRM** systems (SAP, Salesforce, Oracle) mandatory for launch, or optional for future phases?
- Should we include **email integration** (e.g., Outlook, Gmail plugins) for encrypted attachments?

## 4. OCR Requirements
- Is OCR strictly limited to **live documents**, or should legacy scanning also be considered as a future add-on?
- What languages should OCR support (English-only or multilingual)?

## 5. Retention & Compliance
- Retention period is stated as **7â€“10 years**. Should this be **configurable per document type** (e.g., policies vs. memos)?
- Should the system include **automatic deletion** post-retention, or only archival?

## 6. Mobile & Remote Access
- The requirement notes mobile access is **not critical**. Should we deprioritize it entirely, or build a responsive web interface for occasional mobile use?

## 7. Analytics & Reporting
- What level of detail is required in **reader analytics**? (e.g., just read/acknowledged vs. time spent, device used, etc.)
- Should analytics support **export to external BI tools** (e.g., Power BI, Tableau)?

## 8. Security Enhancements
- Should **MFA** and advanced role masking be offered only in **Option 3**, or as an optional add-on to all tiers?
- Are there any **industry-specific compliance certifications** required (ISO, HIPAA, etc.)?

## 9. Data Migration
- What volume of **legacy documents** is expected for migration at go-live?
- Should migration include **metadata cleanup and deduplication**?

## 10. Support & Maintenance
- What SLA levels are expected (response times, resolution times)?
- Should support include **24/7 monitoring**, or business-hours only?
