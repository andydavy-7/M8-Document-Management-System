# Requirement Analysis Document (requirement_analysis.md)

## 1. Business Objective & Current State Analysis

### Business Objective
To implement a **secure, flexible, and compliant Document Management System (DMS)** that:
- Ensures centralized control of corporate documents (policies, procedures, memos).
- Automates the document lifecycle (draft → review → approval → publish → change tracking).
- Strengthens compliance (GDPR, retention 7–10 years, audit trails, reader acknowledgments).
- Scales across varied client infrastructures (on-prem legacy systems vs. cloud-first environments).
- Provides modular adoption paths through **Option 1 (core)**, **Option 2 (enhanced)**, and **Option 3 (advanced)**.

### Current State & Challenges
- Many organizations rely on **manual, fragmented processes** (email-driven approvals, shared drives).
- **Compliance gaps**: weak audit trails, no clear proof of review/acknowledgment, inconsistent retention.
- **Operational risks**: data breaches, version confusion, outdated documents in circulation.
- **Vendor lock-in** fears with standard products; **cost and maintenance risks** with fully custom solutions.
- **Infrastructure diversity**: some clients operate on legacy servers (on-prem only), others expect cloud SaaS.

### Problem Statement
Organizations require a DMS that provides **compliance-grade document lifecycle management** while being **adaptable in deployment, scalable in features, and cost-flexible**.

## 2. The Solution Concept

A **tiered, modular DMS platform** delivered in three option packages:

### Option 1: Entry-Level (Core Compliance)
- Document lifecycle: draft, review, approval, publish
- Version control & access permissions (internal/external)
- Secure storage (50GB, up to 400MB per file)
- Reader acknowledgment (“read & understood”)
- Retention/archiving (7–10 years)
- GDPR-compliant encryption & security firewall

### Option 2: Mid-Tier (Enhanced Compliance & Analytics)
- All Option 1 features
- Adobe Sign integration for e-signatures
- Enhanced analytics (document status, reader behavior, usage trends)
- Expanded storage (~100GB+)
- Configurable workflows (multi-step approvals, reminders)
- External access for auditors/partners

### Option 3: Advanced (Feature-Rich & Customizable)
- All Option 1 + 2 features
- OCR for live documents (searchable PDFs/images)
- Advanced storage (150GB+)
- Deeper integrations (ERP, CRM if needed)
- Advanced security: MFA, role-based data masking
- AI-assisted metadata tagging & smart search (future roadmap)
- Custom branding & dashboards
- Multi-cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, Google)

## 3. Core Functions & Capabilities

- **Document Lifecycle Management**: Draft → Review → Approve → Publish
- **Change Management**: Create & track change memos, approval workflows, audit trails
- **Access Control & Security**: Role-based permissions, internal/external user access, encryption (AES-256/128)
- **Reader Analytics**: Track read, understood, signed-off acknowledgments
- **Version Control**: Automated version tracking, recirculation of new versions
- **Storage & Retention**: Configurable storage (50–150GB), retention policies (7–10 years), secure archiving
- **Integrations**: Adobe Sign, ERP/CRM (advanced), multi-cloud storage compatibility
- **Optional Features**: OCR (live documents), AI metadata tagging, custom branding

## 4. User Journeys

### Persona 1: Document Author/Manager
- Creates draft policy → uploads to system
- Assigns reviewers & approvers
- Tracks approval status (pending, approved)
- Publishes approved version → employees notified

### Persona 2: Approver/Manager
- Receives approval notification → reviews document
- Approves or requests changes
- Signs off via Adobe Sign (Options 2 & 3)
- Provides audit-ready trail of decision

### Persona 3: Employee/Consumer
- Logs into portal → accesses “latest approved” policies
- Reads document → marks as “understood”
- Audit record reflects acknowledgment

### Persona 4: System Admin
- Configures storage & retention rules
- Manages roles, permissions, and external auditor access
- Enforces GDPR compliance & encryption settings
- Monitors reader analytics, system health, and audit logs
